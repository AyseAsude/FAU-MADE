# Top Emission Sources: Sectoral Trends in Air Pollution in Germany (1995-2021)

Climate change has been a topic of discussion for decades. With the rise of natural phenomena such as
unusual heat waves, floods, and droughts, people have become more aware of their impact on the climate.
Air emissions significantly contribute to human-induced climate change driven by modern-day
consumption patterns.

Air emissions refer to the gases and particles released into the atmosphere from various sources. Among
these, the increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane pose a significant risk to
the environment and is a major cause of climate change. In addition to greenhouse gases, airborne
particles also threaten human health. Analyzing targeted data can yield valuable insights that help mitigate
the effects of climate change.

# Question

**Which industries emit the most air pollutants and greenhouse gases over the years in Germany?**

The focus of this project is to understand the amount of air emissions produced by each economic sector
in Germany and identify the sectors with the highest emissions over the years. By identifying the economic
sectors that generate the most air emissions, we can better target reduction efforts and raise awareness
about our consumption habits.
